# Asset Management Platform

A React-based platform for efficiently managing and visualizing industrial assets, developed with a focus on performance, data organization, and intuitive filtering.

## Key Features

- **Optimized Performance**: Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React for faster load times. Leveraged lazy loading to split components and reduce initial load.
- **Enhanced Data Structuring**: Improved data architecture for better maintainability and scalability. Each module is organized to ensure a cohesive, manageable structure.
- **Advanced Filtering System**: Intuitive filtering capabilities to quickly search, categorize, and visualize assets based on user-defined parameters.
- **React Query for Caching**: Leveraged React Query to cache asset data, reducing network requests and improving load times.
- **Image Compression**: Integrated image compression plugin to further enhance performance.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. **Run the development server** (default port: 5173):
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Future Improvements

I aim to make text search more precise by adopting a more integrated approach with the back-end, allowing for more accurate and harmonious search results across the platform.
